#Web Application Automation Testing

## Introduction

Testing is a crucial part of any solution and can be done from many different perspectives; the 
internal development team testing, business user acceptance testing (UAT), etc. There are also 
many different types of testing that can be conducted on a solution and user acceptance testing 
is usually done very manually. UAT is often included in most development lifecycles as a crucial 
step that acts as the ‘go/no-go’ decision maker. UAT is focused on ensuring that the input entered 
into the solution generates the expected output. If the solution does not generate the desired 
output, the solution needs to be amended and retested as the solution would generally not be 
published to production unless it passes all tests in UAT. 
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) refers to the use of technology to mimic human tasks in the 
same way that a person would execute a process. This usually refers to, what we would call, 
‘front-end’ or UI (User Interface) automation. RPA is often used to automate time-consuming and 
highly repetitive tasks to allow people the availed capacity to work on more intuitive tasks.

Before the solution can be deployed into production, it would need to go through UAT where a team of ‘testers’ would have 
a test dataset containing input data and desired output data. The testers would then insert each 
record of input data into each field of the web application and test that the desired output is 
generated. In this case, the desired output would be a new record being displayed on the web 
application once the item has been added. This would resort in a highly repetitive process which 
can and should (in this case) be automated using RPA.
